# Temporal patterns

## Overview
This software repository contains an experimental software implementation of an
algrebraic algorithm based on constrained multilinear seiving for
solving a set of pattern-detection problems in temporal graphs. It is a
parameterised algorithm, which runs in edge-linear time and the exponential
complexity is restricted to size of the  multiset query. The software is
written in C programming language.

This version of the source code is realeased for SDM - 2020 submission titled
"Pattern detection in large temporal graphs using algebraic fingerprints".
